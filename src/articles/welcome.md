We are happy to finally have our new site live! We've spent many hours thinking about how to best serve our clients through this website which our developers are actually calling a 'Web App', whatever that means!

The site is broken down into several sections, each an area where we excell! Visitors can navigate through the sections depending on their needs and pick a service or product or choose from our homepage any of our services, submit a request or contact us with the click of a button.

We hope this site provides value and information to our customers and that they come to it often to schedule a repair, pickup, delivery, rental or purchase.

## What we do best!

1. Endoscope repair
2. Endoscope rental
3. New Products
